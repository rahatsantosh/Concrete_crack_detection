<h1>Concrete Crack Detection</h1>
<p>Crack detection has vital importance for structural health monitoring and inspection. We would like to train a network to detect Cracks, we will denote the images that contain cracks as positive and images with no cracks as negative.</p><br>
<p>This model applies transfer learning on Resnet-18 pre-trained model in order to classify the input images of concrete as positive or negative.</p>
